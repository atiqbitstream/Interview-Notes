## Conflict Resolution Styles

### 1. Collaborative (Win-Win)
Both parties work together to find solution that satisfies everyone.

**When to use:**
- Complex issues
- Important relationships
- Time available
- Creative solutions needed

**Example:**
"We disagreed on architecture, so we each prototyped our approach and presented pros/cons. We ended up combining the best of both designs."

### 2. Compromising (Split the Difference)
Each party gives up something to reach agreement.

**When to use:**
- Time constraints
- Equal power
- Temporary solution needed
- Both parties need to win something

**Example:**
"We couldn't agree on sprint length, so we tried 2-week sprints (their preference) for one quarter, then 1-week sprints (my preference) for the next, and evaluated."

### 3. Accommodating (Lose-Win)
One party yields to the other.

**When to use:**
- Issue more important to other person
- Preserving relationship is priority
- You realize you're wrong
- Building goodwill

**Example:**
"I preferred React but the team had more Angular experience. I accommodated their preference to maintain velocity and team confidence."

### 4. Competing (Win-Lose)
Standing firm on your position.

**When to use:**
- Ethical issues
- Safety concerns
- Critical decisions
- You're certain you're right

**Example:**
"I insisted on proper security measures despite time pressure. Security is non-negotiable, and I presented the risks clearly."

### 5. Avoiding (Lose-Lose)
Postponing or withdrawing from conflict.

**When to use (rarely):**
- Trivial issues
- Need more information
- Too heated, need cool-down
- Others can resolve better

**Approach:**

**Challenge:** Performance/effort issue

**Approach:**
- Have private conversation
